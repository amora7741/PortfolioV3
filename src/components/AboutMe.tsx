      <p>
        From a young age, I&apos;ve had a fascination with web development and
        the idea of writing code to bring ideas to life on a screen. This
        interest of mine really took off during a Software Engineering course I
        took at Cal Poly Pomona, where I built a full-stack application as a
        final project, and I haven&apos;t looked back since.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project gave me my first hands-on experience with managing both
        frontend and backend code. While challenging to build, it was rewarding
        to see the final product come to life. Now, I focus on and enjoy
        building responsive, visually appealing, and intuitive web applications.
        I enjoy working with Next.js and using its powerful features to create
        great user experiences. Alongside that, I have experience using React,
        Node, and both SQL and NoSQL databases to build robust full-stack
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from that, I am a huge fan of the Lakers and have been one my
        whole life. The only time I&apos;ve caught a game in person ended in a
        loss, but the experience was great either way! I&apos;m due for a win
        next time!
